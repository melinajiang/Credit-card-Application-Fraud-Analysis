# Credit-card-Application-Fraud-Analysis
Identity fraud is a common problem when it comes to credit risk. It is an act of misrepresenting which person you are to improperly get products or services (financial services, consumer products...) or to stay “unidentified” while behaving badly (money laundering, terrorists...). The behavior is generally classified as three modes: Identity Theft, Identity Manipulation and Synthetic Identity.
The purpose of this Application (Identify) Fraud project is to look for anomalies among records of “application data” file using a real time fraud algorithm (supervised models) normally applied to deal with identity fraud. Our goal is to build and tune a model that has the highest FDR (fraud detection rate) when examining 3% of the record population. And we believe such a model will help find out the optimal division point to target suspicious applications from a business perspective.
